### üìÅ Data Collection

* Password strength data was collected on the Kaggle and this dataset contains 80000 amount of observation as well as two featuresn which are password and strength. This strength has three level which are low strength, medium strength and strong strenth
* This project has tried with SVM, Logistic Regression and XGBoosting ML algorithms wit
* The dataset used can be downloaded [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KrishArul26/Password-Strength-Prediction-Deployment/main/Password_strength_data.csv) 

### üîë Prerequisites
* All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/KrishArul26/End-to-End-Deployment-Air-Quality-Index-prediction/blob/main/requirements.txt)
## This project has tried with SVM, Logistic Regression and XGBoosting ML algorithms with 80000 amount of the data

# Conclusion
### Among those model SVM has been selected because the SVM has a higher ROC-Value than the logistic regression model.
